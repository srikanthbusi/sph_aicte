                        <p>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Madras researchers have developed a new technique that
                             promises to help avoid sudden power shutdowns by making it easier to monitor levels of
                             pollution deposits in power transmission networks.
                             The reliability of electric power systems largely depends on the performance of the electrical
                              insulation. But, the outdoor insulation on the transmission lines and the substation equipment 
                              are subjected to environmental pollution, in addition to the electrical, thermal, and mechanical stresses.
                             The pollution-related electrical flashover can lead to blackouts and the collapse of the system.</p>

                        <h4>IIT Madras’ Open House 2022 features over 60 innovative tech projects by students</h4>
                        <p>Open House 2022, hosted by the Centre for Innovation (CFI) at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras recently,
                             featured over 60 innovative tech projects made by students of the institute.

                            After a gap of two years, the event returned to a physical mode and showcased autonomous vehicles, rockets and the first-ever electric formula car from the institute made by team Raftar.
                            For the first time, this edition was also made accessible on a Metaverse platform called Gather Town to a limited audience this year to highlight the innovations to people who could not be physically present at the event.

                            Over 1,500 people, including around 100 industrialists and IIT Madras alumni, participated in-person with another 500 taking part virtually through Gather Town.</p>

                        <h4>This IIT-Mumbai-based professor-student duo’s electric planes are ready to take flight</h4>
                        <p>While the majority of the EV action takes place on ground, the human desire to fly high remains undiminished. In industrialised economies, small electric planes are already being commercialised, but Indian companies aren’t far behind. The founders of the ePlane Company, based at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M), are working on what they hope would be the country’s first air taxis, as well as cargo transport planes small enough for last-mile delivery.

                            Satya Chakravarthy, an IIT-M professor, and his student Pranjal Mehta Co-founded the ePlane Company. They’re currently testing a scaled-down prototype and hope to have their first cargo plane ready by the end of the year. The entrepreneurs have also recently raised $1 million in their series A round of funding.
